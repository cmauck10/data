d1fdcdba,If it were me I'd want to try and find out more about how/why this happened first before I continued to use that software. Have you asked at the talk page I mentioned above?

117c6f50,"Btw, I've issued a request for discussion on the Canadian Wikipedians' notice board about a dispute involving myself and another contributor on <url>. If you have a chance, could you look this over?"
5fb81bda,"With all due respect, that is going to take ages. How can one create a 'Bot' to do all this for me for <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>?"
3d961d64,"They did and have done, on my talk page and on their talk page and most the time im not really doing anything and i always seem to get the finger pointed at me. So what do you expect me to do if someone is uncivil towards me?"
1a5c49ba,My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un-ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes?

c7a8d23c,"Hi, I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this.  Could you see my comments on <url>?"
6a9adbcf,"I hope I don't upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self-created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non-free content criteria? Is this caveat hiding in a talk page archive somewhere?"
2758fb9c,"So far so good? Drop me an email sometime, ok?"
eacee178,I'm currently considering nominating you for adminship at <url>. Are you interested?
532e9d3a,Hi. I stumbled upon your user page and was wondering if you could offer any tips for creating locator maps... where do you get the 'base' map and what program do you use to fill in the colours?
ed638556,"OK, we are talking about two remaining articles here. The categories serve absolutely no categorization purpose, so why are you being stubborn about it?"
edb78048,"Somebody labeled the ""stenography"" images you did for <url> as unverified.  Would you midn adding a tag to those, too?"
45781218,"Fine, but you didn't need to be an admin to make edits to articles.  Or did you?"
759a1c9e,"Hi. How do you think, is <url> of FL quality?"
d15d288c,"All right, I'll bite. Is honorary membership in the Justice League not criteria enough for being listed in that category?"
69420aa5,"Your first attempt at doing this also added a <nowiki>""<url>""</nowiki> line to the article, and that's what triggered the bot.  Perhaps you should get into the habit of using the 'Show changes button?"
00129c82,"I see you deleted the Shayla LaVeaux article, citing copyright problems. I'd like to see if I can't clean it up... is there any way I can see the deleted article?"
e92d4968,"The link you provided to speedy delection criteria only goes up to CSD12, and there is no CSD 13 listed there.  Could you clarify?"
e3808460,"Hi again, OK, say we don't go along the lines of Blair will go before the end of 2007; but we list the announced candidates for when Blair does resign (which will inevitably happen at some point). Do you think this would be any better/more suitable?"
369a8b74,"Hi, you've done a lot of work on comparing FA country articles. Are you aware of any country that got special praise for the selection of images in the article?"

9b6dd720,"Hey, several of the footnotes that you use in <url> are Harvard footnotes, which means that they need the full citation of the books in works cited section. I imagine you grabbed some of that information from some other places, would you mind retriveing the bibliographic data?"
2531aa33,"Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?"

360b0a93,"Yep, I'm definitely free for the whole break. Had fun in your trip?"
4ff1a37d,Do you really believe that your photograph at the top of the <url> is better than my photograph which you removed? Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky?
ad86f122,"Am I indeed ""dishonest"" by responding to you?  Is <url>  correct?"
6a2b35c2,"The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I'm not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts?"
bb5706d5,He's still got the youtube link on there even after your reversion. How does once vs. 25 times or so make any difference?
80d87d1a,The new features of Hotcat are excellent: whom do I thank for this? :-) Are you still its maintainer?
80798b16,"I made the revert as an editor, not an Administrator - I haven't used my Admin tools and I have said I would not use them as I'm involved. Where did I say I hadn't read any of the material?"
206b4496,"I was just curious why you named the <url> for Williamsburg County, not Georgetown County.  Is it because W County is listed first by the GNIS?"
ac0fe53f,You also seem somedeal similar to <url>. Not logging in is not sockpuppetry but do you acknowledge that User:64.194.44.220 is you?
a711cdd3,Lowell/Lawrence Blvd leading from Lowell to the Methuen Rotary is a device from hell as well.  How many people does that short stretch of road have to kill?
b4d777da,I tagged the most recent article. Aren't there guidelines for public history in your state?
fe7a06c6,"---- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>'''500'''</big> edits while on ""wikibreak"" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that???"
f4e82ae3,"Just looking at that photo and the one in the article makes me feel cold :).   I just finished this article <url> a week or so ago, and wonder if those Forward Operating Locations are tied into intercepts from those NORAD radar sites ?"

5c30a57e,Good idea.... Perhaps though you could also make a list of kings on that page??
6394c58d,"When someone explicitly states that they created the image themselves, then surely GFDL is at least implied? I know i forgot to add the tag but is it really necessary to put a delete template on the image?"
06e7a4e3,"I've been trying to convince this user that his only problem is his username, but he doesn't seem to fully believe it.  Would you mind popping over and giving a word or two of encouragement?"
8f0e6dd2,Where is the vandalism? Diffs?
585f3750,I believe that an opinion about AS belongs only to article about AS (and you are welcome to cite the MS opinion ''in proper context''). However an opinion about MS belongs only to article about MS. Is not this fair and logical?

7be45211,"Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission?"

bccdeeea,"Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?"
ef0e8b0f,Could you please block me indefinitely. If you can't then what do I need to do to get blocked indefinitely?
e8d03de4,"Hi, Matt. Aren't you supposed to be banned?"
f10d3eb2,Many thanks for the review. So what was the truce term ''you'' used when little then?
5ffb2729,"Not to worry. What's ""D.M.""?"
c2fb159a,"Hi, I noticed <url> of yours, claiming a <url> violation. Mind explaining that?"
66793a7a,"I have never seen anything which says that warning levels should begin anew each day. <url> says that warning templates ""are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession."" If there is another policy somewhere, could you show it to me?"
0bf14fc1,"Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten's personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article... sound familiar?"
88e4ae50,"Hey, I just went ahead and reverted <url>. I was wondering if you wanted your userpage semi-protected to prevent that happening in the future?"

01ba00b0,"No, I don't know of any way to measure the number of visitors to articles.  Perhaps someone on the <url> can answer your question?"
790d229b,Thanks for your reply. I've tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now?
ebf5c20e,"Thanks for the redirect help!  Is that something I can do myself in the future, or is that an admin thing?"
ae3d5ef2,To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they're rendered.  Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you've made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?
289d8ef9,Cheers!  Don't suppose you have a link.....?
b13dedd7,"Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I've noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long-deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again. I'm just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and/or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one?"
dfea7e7a,"Thank you, I was wondering what type of unit this was. Civil Defence, some kind of police squad, or perhaps even Freikorps?"
06cba839,"Greetings, and thank you for your cogent remarks at <url>.  Would you be interested in voting in the straw poll <url> as well?"
979e86d9,"I'm sorry, but I don't see the edit if you're referring to the <url> article.  Are you referring to something else?"
e59b8e9c,"Seeing you back on Wikipedia after a long time. How are you doing, and is everyone you know safe?"
48f4684d,Your bot takes zh:u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it?
e4a44d63,Hmm. Over?
6278c9a0,"I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self-promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it?"
5c35e490,"Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from ""People from Alabama"" to ""People from Elmore County, Alabama"". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before?"
fb975599,"Even worse: ""The authorized use of this data is limited to informational and educational purposes only, and NOT for operational or commercial purposes."" This clearly disqualifies the text for Wikipedia purposes, I'm afraid we'll have to delete the article. Do you know of any similar contributions you've made?"
4fc8b834,<url>! Shall we greet him as he deserves?
579d4370,"Gee, thanks. But shouldn't it be a barnstar for '''''bad''''' humor, or maybe for the humor ""phlegm""?"
358919de,"<url> is having <url> spelling ""<url>"".  Perhaps you could help?"
7459b1f9,"These are my numbers: 7 years in Wikipedia, 6 years as an admin, 570+ articles, 4 featured articles, 1 featured list, 21 Good articles, 60 DYK's - After six years as an admin. I recently made some mistakes and I can understand if I am placed in some type of probation were I am monitored and forbidden to use my tools maybe for a year, but do I really merit the removal of my adminship?"
ae27e67e,"""''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''"". Listen, it's just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them?"
3136d053,"In terms of suitability for an article, as I understand it, Merrill's ""claim to notice"" is due to the company (work done by SOM, size of SOM, etc), and also because of the important changes he made to that company. Is that roughly correct?"
002100c9,Hi John. Do you have any more edits to make before I start the merge?
dc0c34b3,So it seems we both already know the problems with the current logo and the SVG one. What can I do to help you?
4bdf287f,You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven't provided my reasoning?
a12aeabf,Perhaps you can help me. How do I view the status of a vandalism report I've made?
5fa86e1d,Links to attack sites and so are not allowed. You must know that you violated BLP?
179f9d7c,I'm not sure what you mean by pointing out that votes were placed before the version you created. Could you elaborate?
ddc72d02,"Thanks. Can you leave a comment at <url>, saying you are the creator?"
7fd293a7,"Since working on the article you wrote, I have become fascinated with this band.  Is any of their music availabe online?"
ea858a71,"Just an FYI, I replied at FPOC. How many lists would you prefer?"
3f997b9f,I'm curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment?  Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue?
fceafba6,Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?
c8c44d0d,"While browsing wikipedia for missing pages to write i saw it on your things to do list. Assuming he's a poet, do you mean <url>?"
741f94f7,"I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>.  Was there any particular reason to move your user/user talk pages to that name, and back again?"
aaa9ca0a,"The block seems to no longer be necessary or productive. If I were to bring a motion to get them unblocked, would you support it?"
b4fc123b,"Okay. What, exactly, can I do about that?"
c1b35c7d,"At first I couldn't see it, but now that I've taken a closer look I see what you mean.  Now, I wonder, who was the first most decorated PR soldier in WW II?"
2b6c30f5,"That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?"
b55461b3,I enjoyed your comments on the 'Road to Serfdom' article. I wonder if you know if anyone has offered a reading of the book as a satire of the bourgeois-administrative-pseudo-capitalist state?
a16b5831,Thanks. Anything else?
7bd65dac,"What is your source for the PD Seantors? There is no news on RTE, ireland.com or the PD website?"

aa85a4c9,"I'm sorry, but I don't see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub-list sorted by nationality be different?"
9b6b80fd,Sorry to not reply earlier regarding Deathrockeru2014I've been away. Has the situation calmed?
bcd162ff,"I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS. ""All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)"" - ess-eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF-channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess-eff used outside fan-groups?"
1785e2c9,"One more thing if you want, let's talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let's talk there instead, ok?"

d131dc21,"On reflection it's up for GA peer review, preparatory to trying for FAC. Would you care to <url>?"
5d88105d,When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?
f31a7892,"So your argument is that as long as you follow the ""rules,"" nothing else should matter? That if it's legal it's OK?"

b85d5934,"I see you have been creating lots of articles on bus stations on the <url>. Considering how little information there is (and is likely to be) for these stations, would it not be better to have them all on one article?"
9505a49e,"<url> - I removed a see-also to a link placed by a COI-editor pointing to a topic about himself, which duplicated an existing link on the same topic.  Exactly what is <em>your</em> reason for the template on my user page?"
da13ef6f,"Thanks. Before I use, is there are way to deny the bot only within a portion of an article rather than the entire article?"
bbd3b9c2,Thanks for adding that ref to <url>. I don't suppose your copy of Conway's says anything about the roles and fates of ''Schleswig-Holstein'' or ''Schleisen''?
5464f574,"No, I didn't know that. Where does this ""rule"" come from?"
1107febe,"Thanks. As an aside, since this did turn out to be factual, just very hard to source, do you think the community would countenance an unblock request from Blaabla if he accepted some strict unblock conditions (such as packing in the 'systemic bias' thing, discussing his edits in a less confrontational manner etc)?"
e5ad1039,"Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I'm not yet reverting your edit to this article.  But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth?"
5dc3b6c4,I assume you like to play '''U.S.''' billiards bottom right corner?

da83ffb9,"Greetings, sorry to bother you here... I have been using the MissingTopics tool for years, to generate <url> The last time I used it successfully was Nov 16.  Something must have changed in the algorhythms since then, because it will no longer read any page starting with an Amharic character... Is it broke?"
10b2bfc0,"I'm usually polite, but this one seemed to need a slap across the face. It's ... words escape me .. mindboggling... jaw-dropping ... ?"
3c1b6cf0,"That sounds fine. When does the drive end: at the start of August 13 or at the end, and according to which timezone?"
8333af61,Calling all changes for vandalism just because you don't agree with them is NOT the way to explain why you reverts edits. May I suggest that you actually learn what vandalism actually means before you use the word?
63737d87,u2013 Use that dash my friend. How are you geting on?
fc73517a,I am not equally confident about this pinning one: <person>. Hector again?

1e1087e7,"Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others?"
6fbd1b92,"It was closed as ""no consensus, default to keep"".  What difference does it make?"
30690777,"It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?"
8d39abe8,"Thank You. What is ""The Prince of Santorini"" anyway?"
4505c194,"Thanks for readjusting the <url> remarks on stationsby - I must confess I'm not that much into Danish history, so my edit contained some guesswork... thanks for correcting me. Do I understand correctly that a Stationsby would not be the station that originaly is intended for a town further away, around which then a new town grows up?"
4d28565d,It's on the talkpage - you are deleting like crazy. I can ask for a Cabral if you like?
c791b42c,"Regarding <url>: <url> seems to say the exact opposite (that links on a dab page should ''not'' be through redirects). The page is at <url>, so shouldn't that be how it's linked on the dab page?"
9e465f8f,"I started working on missing translations of news titles inside citations, but discovered that square brackets leave an ugly residue, while round ones may not be optimal, since they clash visually with the ""language"" ones. Would it be acceptable to just use the English version as title?"
c10ad200,"An excellent news, indeed! I don't have time to have a look at it right now (busy with the fr FA), but do they have something on Gndevank?"
f30b8aa9,I wasn't sure what you mean by making the title a clickable link. Can you show me how to do that?

7d9fb294,"Don't worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you're still not convinced you should get an account?"
14ed921a,"Hi, hopefully I will have the <url> ''wonderful-joy-of-a-job'' task done by tomorrow so will be able to join you with the infobox-adding task thereafter. Do you have a method, or is it just A &ndash; Z?"
0f486a0d,I'm curious how you justify your removal of a link to the Washington Blade newspaper website in the <url> article<url>. The Blade is a valid media outlet - a newspaper dating back to 1969. Is there some bias at work?
487814b7,You removed posts by me as well.  Do you have any explanation?
cc7446dd,"Most of the editors who would care about the deletion of KiK's threads are the ones who would agree with him, so it's pointless to warn them.  Hell ... come to think of it, hasn't KiK been all over their talk pages, with them high-fiving each other?"

7a863181,"When I wrote <url> I was not quite sure if it was a synonym of <url>, and hence did not perform a merge. Could you clarify if they are indeed the same, and if so whether we should merge the articles?"
a3128fb5,"Regarding our WikiProject discussion about airport naming, I am unsure about Wiki etiquette - should I edit your sandbox with links indicating the common name (i.e. airport even though it's an aerodrome) or should I list them on my own talk page?"

3e62896d,"Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it's not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it's still more meaningless work to change everything once again.

574cae09,"Hi, ixb4d like to know why are you constantly removing all information i put in your scm comparison about Plastic SCM. donxb4t we have the right to show there our information as the rest of users?"
a8d565ff,"As does ''<url>'', and ''<url>'', and even ''<url>''. Wanna be friends?"
4336dbf4,"In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non-free image with J. Malcolm Greany's ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?"
66dd2dc2,"Hi, would you have any objection to renaming the sub-categories of <url> to look more like the articles which describe them - i.e. <url> -> <url> and so on?"
97c4c47f,You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album?
19b5ef75,"I put both in the first sentence, to show a range.  Is that OK?"
9849113a,"Saw your edits on <url> - all good - but I have a question. What does ""collapse <url>"" mean in your edit summary?"
54975a6f,<url> suddenly has a bunch of new entries for today. Did you change the program?
42c5a25a,Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?
2cfbf787,Not too sure now you come to mention it. Do i need to annihilate it?
f3de6cf0,"You assume correctly; same principle would apply. :-) By the way, is there a trick to getting the (Talk) link in your signature automatically that I haven't learned yet?"
719889fc,"Due to your edits to this template, <url> is now required on all transclusions.  Are you running a bot to clean this up?"

3e5d020c,"Do you know how to make the 'All Star Template' appear only at the bottom, as well as the 'Confirmed future sites', so the actual table appears at the top of the page??"
ecdbf93d,I noticed that you are the major contributor to the articles. Mind if I nominate <url> at <url>?
64ca54b6,Indian cultural imperialism is rampant this am - what nxt? we have had the mongolians and indians - maybe the astragoths next?
d6ccb77f,Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn't we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time?

d4609f06,"What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur?"

2ee142c6,"Hi MariAna, there are just a couple of outstanding issues with the article. Could you have a look at them so I can get the GA closed in the next few days?"
11f6b9ec,I'm not familiar with that article. Can you please specify the exact article title?
63506b52,"That's still not the original source, and after searching through a few pages on Flickr, I'm assuming the original is all rights reserved anyway. Can I ask why you believe it is public domain?"
8cd5894e,Figures as much. What's wrong with it?
9ebcbcf6,"I was just about to create an article on the 2009 Malawian election; the purpose of adding it to the template was to give me a convenient link when I decided to do it. If red linked elections can't go in the template, why don't you delete all the red linked past elections?"
05882bed,"One question - how come the page is marked as ""in dispute""?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?"
f73fc568,"OK, now I see the <url>. Wouldn't it have been better to just say ""see talk"" in the edit summary so that editors don't think that you just moved it on a childish whim?"
30611f70,"I noticed you added the Jean Chretien link to the homepage, which is nice, but you didn't put any comment for the changelog and you also didn't bump of the last article, you bumped off the 2nd last article.  Why?"
e1c17a1b,"Sure, I'll have a look at it. It looks like it needs a bit of a copyedit though, hope you don't mind?"
eddf1ec1,Thanks for clean-up of the secret talkpage colourer-inner. Aren't people odd?
a61332b8,"Everything about <url> looks fantastic, but.. going to |2 instead of |30em seems like a major step back. Is there a reason for it?"
6d090733,The profile seems good as it is. Why don't we bring this back up after the Hibiki 2-parter?
3de666b8,Just wondering why removed death material? Perhaps another article on his death and circumstances- legacy?
cf00efc3,I see that there now. Do you want me to tie it all in or do you want to work on it?
bfbea4e6,"""Malbrain, I can't understand you, in either your comments to the talk page..."" is the criteria being used by user WHOSASKING to make reverts of my edits.  Since when does any one editor have to understand all the material of a subject known by the other editors?"
cc03a8ee,Why on earth have you deleted the article on the <url>?  Can you please undelete it?
d17f9511,Eh. Awesome as in you are going to be more active?
f3918868,"I presume you haven't obliterated them completely, because that would be to be editorialise enormously. Where have you put them instead?"
a198bc94,"There is a lot to learn - but to date I have concentrated on content, followed by style. If I have to keep removing silly comments, though, I will get discouraged - is there an easy way to reverse somebody's goofing?"
dd8c4bde,"I actually went to the long term abuse page right now, and tried to block them, but it seems that those accounts don't exist. Have they been listed incorrectly?"
decf287e,"...cause I feel like a petulant kid, posting it. But: ""We have three volunteers: Awadewit, Mike Christie and Wrad."" Given that I, you know, proposed the countries idea, wasn't it obvious that I was volunteering?"
7f7778d0,I'm not sure what you are reffering to. Could you give a link?
d31d5e8f,my edit was described as ''(Reverted 1 edit by 64.53.137.232 (talk): Rv. (TW))'' and I didn't give the guy a warning or anything so how would anyone think I was calling him a vandal?
d8df711a,I can't remember if I asked/checked to see if it got to you? So... did it?
53e069de,Thanks! To be absolutely fair his earlier edits to Rumble Fighter seemed serious; maybe he left the pc untended?
fb85cf2a,"Hmm.  You ''do'' realize that two of the ""please sign"" diffs are from <url>, and that the talk page is splashed with <person> which has the sig thingy?"
a80c5602,Thanks for reverting that obnoxious vandalism on my talk page.  How do I bring in an administrator to deal with the vandal?
40aa73bb,Probably I would have to do quite a bit of alteration in wording. Is that O.K?
bd8efabe,"Evidently, I don't have enough consciousness, because I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about. Could you tell me?"
9d8b1839,"I think I'll leave it to the Math WikiProject to decide whether the dab page should be at <url> or <url> since they'll be more familiar with the importance of the various functions.  It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project, right?"
2405fedd,"It's not too long, certainly; but the extended quote does look a bit out of place there.  Perhaps it would be possible to move the bulk of the quote into the body of the article and leave a short phrase or two that could be inline with the second paragraph?"
7853a4fe,I know this is a bit outside your usual territory but I wonder if you would be interested in helping us get <url> to FA status in time for the 50th anniversary of the line's closure on 10 June 2011? A question has also arisen in connection with the proper referencing of a journal article using the sfn template: when quoting a journal article - say from January 2010 - should the correct formulation be <nowiki><person></nowiki> or should the month be dropped?
ed6ca3e1,Note however that <url> does not exist. Which page were you talking about in this case?
bb286a32,"And it ''takes'' thousands and thousands of dollars to run a campaign, so exactly what's your point? Has there actually been some evidence of wrongdoing on anyone's part?"
2de53898,"OK, then, define ""bias"", propose a way to quantify it, and if it's accepted by consensus, we'll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence?"
49c84bb5,I will readily grant that. But where was the urgent reason not to follow it in any of the above cases?
42223dd6,Welcome to wikipedia? Does <url> and <url> look like unreferenced uselessness to you?
7ddc055e,I'm still scratching my head. How can this be?

ba62e480,"Sorry, I didn't know. I added a tag, are you able to delete it?"
6587e21d,I made a change to your user page. Is that the change you wanted?
28ab836a,"I removed most of the boldface lettering from the article. And what do you mean by ""the referencing is insuficcient""?"
c3ccb276,I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop. And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn't enough information?
2089cf21,"I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these ""quotations?"" What qualifies as a quotation?"

aa26891e,"Regarding comment on ""length of Performance reviews"" section - the intention here is to provide support for the statement in the biography that ""Latsabidze is already regarded by many as one of the more significant performers of his generation"". Do you recommend that I just delete this statement, or is there some other way to support it other than providing representative critical reviews that say so?"
a098c972,"Good point for the text, but can I also add the photos? They seem to be out of copyright, but maybe not?"
3bcaea25,"<url> is based at 340 Laurier Avenue West Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0P9 - It doesn't have a photo posted yet. Is this convenient for you?"
1fb2aadc,"One to go. Shouldn't ""now welcome"" be ""not welcome""?"
a90e2da1,"Some time ago, you uploaded separate maps for each town and unincorporated community in <url>.  Do you have similar maps for any other counties, or a town-level map of the entire state?"
f89c03fa,"BTW, I translated the page to the best of my ability (my Spanish only carried me so far). Do you speak Portuguese?"
5d6ea6e9,Are you saying that Racepacket attempted to contact Laura's employer? When and where did this happen?
4cada11f,During your RFA you stated that you would be helping deal with the Scibaby situation after Raul stopped doing it. Do you feel that you've done what you said you were going to do?
d177908d,"I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again.  Are you still interested in such a thing?"
54498de4,I don't see any of that in his deletion log.  Would you please find out which one it was as evidence so you're not blindly accusing an admin of deleting something they didn't delete?
0d13d95b,"Alternatively, maybe the second column could be '''Country of origin''' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA/Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA/USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts?"
80f0e5ca,The main article needs a facelift. Do you want to make suggestions?
9f1f107e,"Huh, looks fine to me. Maybe this computer just lies to me to get me to shut up and stop complaining?"

455d27e4,"Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn't find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what?"
95c39649,Thanks! Do you know why this was held jointly and what was worked on?
e2918b12,"Hi.  Would it be OK to move the timeline to a template, so that all the Mars-related geology pages can point to the same timeline, making updates easier?"
d596ad78,Changing your userpage doesn't answer my question. Why is your userpage a copy of <url>'s?
6440e5a8,"I agree with Orlady here; full-protection, a fairly serious position when we're talking about an encyclopedia anyone can edit, is only to be taken out as a last (reasonable) resort. Since both participants to the dispute are now blocked, is there any reason for the protection to be necessary?"
fec6f41b,"Hi, Leandrod - my computer is slow, and your last two edits were made on top of vandalism that needed to be reverted - I can't tell if I reverted legit changes by you or not?  If I did, I'm sorry, can you have a look?"
58470379,Noticed you've been holding the fort alone... again :) Thought I'd drop by and say hello. Surely your sanity has reached its limits by now?

bca3cebd,Yes I am planning to. Is that good?
b2884be1,On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?
058e5e09,I'm not even sure who this person is! Which page is this about?
983a459b,Oh..it is a spider with 'pajek'. Is it really necessary?
5683f4f5,I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side-by-side.  Do you agree?
bd37904a,"It's not my job to add the ""Bronze Age"" material in the article on <url>, so please refrain from removing existing material just because you haven't made any effort to add the ""Bronze Age"" content. OK ?"
9b5d6025,"Have made some comments on your list, looks pretty good overall, my points are just picky ones!  Any chance you could return the favour and have a look over <url> for me?"

6877712c,"Thanks for your work in cleaning up <url> (which is now finished, but for a few hard cases which likely will require the writing of articles to conform to those links). Would you like to collaborate on another section of this list?"

ca1f9475,"I never programmed that up because there were so few portal reviews, far fewer even than portal candidates. How often does this happen?"

fe2ae984,This is irritating. What browser are you using?
d1a4d4cd,"See my comments on the article's talk page, which is on my watchlist by the way. Be bold?"

fc573e33,"In your nom of Everyking you wrote ''...as Everyking is a former administrator, he made over 1,300 in his 2+ year time as a sysop.'' Should that be over 1,300 sysop actions?"

c4703575,"Hi Tim, I received the photograph from Delft but it's page looks a mess and I can't edit it. Can you, or do you know someone who can, fix it?"
05d50a08,"I have to say, I've reviewed the suggestions that ""year in x"" not be piped, and I vehemently disagree. As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk:Piped link|talk page]], ""[s]ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91;2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard-to-follow writing&mdash;better to use no links at all).""

dc3a0f4b,"Yeah, but playtime is over.  Find some articles to edit, yes?"
431df2fa,I'm also having to use your link.  Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up?
c9ad1398,"I notice that your userpage announces that this is an alternate account and won't get involved in policy. Did you always have that attitude, or is it since December last year?"
9bc4ea59,(undent) Your Chinese is much better than mine. Is it possible in Chinese to omit a conjunction such as u548c or u8ddf and let a string of two successive nouns refer to a set of two objects?
3a6ce672,"And I guess with exception of 7 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, everybody else would end up in ""homophobia"" category. Or what would be the threshold?"
5fcd83ef,"As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to ""encourage"" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the ""mocking"" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?"
03387e0b,Being too efficient can be detrimental - what if I was doing it in the wrong order - does that allow my reversion if indeed I do utilise the abbreviation?  A simple enquiry might have been in order?

bc44a563,"Dear commander, this source: '''* Berg, Ole F.: <person>, Oslo 1997 ISBN 82-993545-2-8''' is a Norwegian source, as signified by the lang|no tag, hence the first letters of months is not supposed to be capital. I thought that tagging sources with lang|no would prevent this problem, isn't that correct?"
47c8586d,"I'm sure. How about we let the sockpuppet investigation let us know for certain, m'kay?"
125f800d,I'm sure you're right but I can't find it in FM and haven't found it anywhere else. Could you cite sources in the article?

f5f4e504,"Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic/Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you.  You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely?"
803fd1a7,"You are right, I apologize not doing so.  A different layout for the template could be interesting (perhaps even with names, or those delivered in person/by text) but I didn't quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks, right?"

9b2926bc,Please explain this <url>. Is there a valid reason why this image was removed?
9c8f0c22,I reverted your change to the Pet Shop Boys article - it was kind of a bizarre change (i would have considered it the work of a vandal were it not for the seemingly valid other wikipedia work you've done). ?
1ab38175,"I didn't have those in <person> because they were already included under the tributaries categories. Is this one of those ""basketball player"" exceptions?"

e9d0f399,"This statement by The Four Deuces <url> makes little sense to me, does this user often obfuscate like this? The source is quite unambiguous in stating ""communist terrorists"" how on earth does this not mean the author is talking of communist terrorism?"

723c3bf3,What the hell? Bitter much?
bbb93652,Reply: I have just found your edits to the talk page of the above article - not impressive at all? I suggest that you take this to <url> and explain why his edits need to be reverted and not yours?
d85bb1c1,Hi Asbestos! This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?

88e60697,"From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?"

f4685b39,Very nice. How could I doubt you?
ae95b259,It's a low-profile page in the sense of not getting much attention from editors. Why do you think addressing Luther's views on grace is necessary to understand contemporary philosophy?

If those are divisions used by Elections BC I guess that's what it is, though....I can make some additions to various pages describing the changes relating to ridings they're made out of and waht areas are in/out in each case.....and since the districts were created in 2008, shouldn't hte title say that instead of 2009?"

7616e2ff,I have no clue.  Isn't there a WikiProject on radio stations you can ask?

Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of ""notability"" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?"

f0ec63ed,"Thanks for offer of help on IRC - terminology completely baffling to me (not helped by freenode instructions written as if translated through several languages into final english) - just which channel are admins supposed to log into, and how does one register when it seems by invitation only.

580f8df4,I really think that the text you have drafted at <url> is far fuller and better than the article as currently drafted. Do you have any objection to me deleting the current text (except for the infobox which I will retain) and importing you text in its entirety?
29e234aa,"Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?"
383d7475,"I noticed, that for users warned before, Huggle still uses level 1 warning. Is there anything I can do?"
e24d4d8f,I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User:Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies?

c0d5b593,Strikehold previously did a <url>.  What do you think about adding it to the template?
f147cfe8,"Sorry, almost forgot. After calling me a ""child"" ""uneducated"" and making remarks to the effect of ""shouldn't be allowed to post on edit Wikipedia"" what grounds have you got to stand on to say I've made personal attacks against you by suggesting vandalism?"
6bbd5c15,"Lunch sounds great, Rocket. Do you have an e-mail address I can use to get in touch with you?"

09e93490,I'm sorry but looking back on that edit I won't stand for that. Don't you think that actually removing the edit summary was a bit... well... let's say 'abusing sysop powers'?
d6171bff,"In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer. Is that line of thinking truly alien to you?"
0049cb2f,"Actually, I think I should route these terms (seismic design, and seismic engineering) to <url>. Does that sound like a better idea?"

dc494ecb,"As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?"

a1dbae4f,This is a great way to deal with external links. Wondering if we should look at applying it almost universally for medical pages?

9e45f04f,"Looks like you've been a bit inactive lately, but on the off-chance you check in soon, take a look at <url> and <url>.  You're probably the most familiar with CoM's style and brand of hostility, do you think Freakshownerd here is his sock?"
b5100023,"You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the ""party"" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

06136fcb,"Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?"
f86cab89,Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader/educator/cop/parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much.  Could 1000 admins handle this?
c1f9589d,"I'm disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent.  Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT:RD?"

9d0ce342,Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?  And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position?
233f0997,"I have just noticed that today a Wikipedia administrator added a POV tag in the u201cPsychohistoryu201d article, which you have contributed to edit. Perhaps someone should do a little work to balance the article and remove the tag?"
20fa7c2d,"Wikipedia is not IMDb, which can easily be used (and is more suited) to providing complete soundtrack listings for pretty much every movie ever made. Would you care to address any of the other points I've brought up?"
3c51508c,"Notability is an issue of common sense: you're writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable ''to me'' than Wal-mart, but who, other than me, actually cares?"
2686fcc7,"Thanks for the help! That info should be on <url> in easy to read form, no?"

06f99311,Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects?
cf639ca5,You took me by surprise on this one with your comment-what about the obedience a diocesan priest owes to his bishop?  And I was under the impression that all Latin-rite priests took simple vows of chastity?
befef1c3,I noticed you've been adding the template <person> to pages - I'm sure there's a good reason but I'm totally puzzled as to why. Can you explain what it does?
e7e4f28c,"I use that template, because it cannot be missed on a page, because it allows for different reasons for blocking (template:blocked is ""vandalism"", only, and takes 2 edits to change to something else), and because it gives instructions for requesting unblock. What is the objection to it?"
6aabe1e5,"Wait a minute! I've done plenty of good edits, where did they all go?"

9d4a1406,"I will say this, though, in the form of a suggestion: it makes me a bit uneasy to see you so involved and sometimes argumentative in your nomination. Why not step back and let the community do its thing?"
4de5980c,Please explain how that is a personal attack? You do realise that someone critisizing your actions is not the same as a personal attack don't you?

6ada16e3,"Hello - some of your writing is a bit hard to understand. Is English your first language, out of curiousity?"
fa00869d,"To be perfectly honest, I really have no idea what you're talking about.  Would it not be simpler to just ''add'' a link to the template (if that is indeed what you mean) than to create a potentially offensive and almost certain to be rapidly deleted category?"

1d561b7e,"I hardly ever agree with Jimintheatl, but that block was bordering on absurd. Fast on the button much?"
6dfdd427,In my opinion that would be more constructive way to approach the solution. What do you think?

656aea0e,thank you. any clue what happened?
1a8a8a15,"Reading your help desk comment, I'm totally confused now. Was it 2005 or 2006?"
9596e2e2,"I understand ''your'' position, however I disagree with it, even regarding the spirit. <ins>Mostly because I don't see linking something as modification of the quote, therefore it's a moot point, even when coupled with bracketed additions.</ins> Perhaps we should see<ins>k</ins> comments from additional editors?"
9929cec9,"Re: <url> and <url>, if you think they are better off as redirects to the suburb/town rather than substubs on the lakes with a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tagline, you only need to overwrite the article with a redirect (or revert to a previous version that was a redirect), leaving the substub in the article history.

99a78b8b,"In instances where there is one major usage of a name and several smaller ones it is conventional to leave the major one in the namespace and have a link in the top to the others (or to <url>.
